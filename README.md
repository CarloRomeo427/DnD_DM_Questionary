# üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è D&D Encounter Balance Tester üêâ

## [**Test your skills as a Dungeon Master!!!**](https://dnddmquestionary-hbnpkcguffzs55scdltrmv.streamlit.app/)

## üìñ About the Project  

The **D&D Encounter Generation Tester** is an interactive **web application** designed to help Dungeon Masters (DMs) test their skills in creating **balanced and engaging combat encounters** for their players.  

A well-balanced encounter should be **challenging but not overwhelming**, ensuring that combat remains **exciting, strategic, and rewarding** without leading to frustration or unfair difficulty.  

This tool uses **official encounter-building rules** from the *Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition Dungeon Master's Guide (DMG)* to calculate **experience point (XP) thresholds** and **enemy multipliers**, helping DMs craft encounters that are properly tuned to their party's strength.  

---

## üéØ **Project Goals**  

- **Teach DMs how to balance encounters effectively** using XP values and multipliers.  
- **Provide an interactive tool** for selecting enemies and immediately calculating the encounter difficulty.  
- **Encourage strategic thinking** by considering action economy, enemy variety, and party composition.  
- **Collect data from human Dungeon Masters** to analyze and understand how real DMs balance challenging fights, improving encounter design recommendations.

## üöÄ **How It Works**  

1. **Generate a random adventuring party** with a button click.  
2. **View character details** by clicking on their class names.  
3. **Choose a set of enemies** (up to 8 creatures) to challenge the party.  
4. The app **calculates the total enemy XP** and applies the **encounter multiplier** based on the number of enemies. 
5. After submitting **3 sets** of enemies, the app will simulate the fights of the selected encounters.
6. To overcome the **stocasticity of dice rolling** each combat is simulated 100 times.
7. At the end of the simulated fights, the **average statistics** for the selections made will be displayed!

## üîß **Encounter Balancing: Key Rules Used**  

The app follows the **official XP budgeting system** from the DMG:  

1. **XP Thresholds for a Level 5 Party (Example for 4 Players)**  
   | **Difficulty** | **XP per Character** | **XP for 4-Player Party** |
   |--------------|------------------|---------------------|
   | Easy        | 250 XP           | 1,000 XP           |
   | Medium      | 500 XP           | 2,000 XP           |
   | Hard        | 750 XP           | 3,000 XP           |
   | Deadly      | 1100 XP         | 4,400 XP           |

2. **Encounter XP Multipliers Based on Number of Enemies**  
   | **Number of Enemies** | **XP Multiplier** |
   |----------------------|----------------|
   | 1  | √ó1 |
   | 2  | √ó1.5 |
   | 3‚Äì6  | √ó2 |
   | 7‚Äì10  | √ó2.5 |
   | 11‚Äì14  | √ó3 |
   | 15+  | √ó4 |

3. **Action Economy Matters** ‚Äì More enemies can be harder even if their XP is lower!
